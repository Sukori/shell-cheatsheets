sort
	-r	sort in reverse order
	-n	sort numbers correctly (Default is lexicographically)
	-k	sort by a specific column
	-u	remove duplicate lines
	-t	specify a delimiter for fileds (default is whitespace)

Example:

sort -n -t',' -k4 -k3r test_dump/file.csv
=> sorts numbers correctly (useful for first column), sets ',' as delimiter, sorts by 4th field, sorts 3th field in reverse order (keeping the first sorting by the 4th field valid)
